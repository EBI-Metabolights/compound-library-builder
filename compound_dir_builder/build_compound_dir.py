"""
This script performs multiple stages of building up an MTBLC compound directory. When run for all MTBLC ID's, the 
overall output constitutes MetaboLights' compound reference layer. Written by callum martin in March 2023. If I am no 
longer at the EBI and you have some questions, feel free to contact me at callumceltic@gmail.com and I will do my best
to help.

Usage:
    python3 StartCompoundBuilder.py --ftp <path_to_reference_files> --destination <path_to_output_dir>
Cron Usage:
    bsub -u metabolights-dev -J "newcompounddirbuild" -q standard -R "rusage[mem=128000]" -M 128000 
    /nfs/production/odonovan/scripts/new_compound_bot.sh

Parameters:
    --ftp: str
        The path to the reference files: mapping.json and reactome.json. Mapping.json is a map of studies to compounds
        to species, so which studies are associated with which compounds, and which species are associated with those 
        compounds. Reactome.json is a cache of reactome pathway data for each chebi compound. Read more about reactome 
        data at https://reactome.org/ .
    --destination: str
        The path to the output directory where the processed compound directories will be saved. Mass Spec .json files 
        will also be saved to the same directory. 

Stages:
    Stage 1: Initialisation 
        This stage prepares several objects needed for the compound_dir_builder to run. These are:
            - CompoundBuilderConfig object, which contains all internal & external API endpoints, as well as keys and 
            maps used to translate API responses to our format.
            - Session object for quicker http requests, shared among threads.
            - Mapping dict, loaded into memory from the mapping.json file
            - Reactome dict, loaded into memory from the reactome.json file.
            - List of all MTBLC id's, retrieved from our legacy java webservice
            - Initialises the compound dict that the script builds up.

    Stage 2: Get Chebi Data
        This stage hits the Chebi API for this MTBLC compound ID. Our IDs (excluding the MTBLC portion) are derived 
        directly from chebi. The response from the chebi API is in xml, so we use xml.ET.find to extract out the 
        information we want. In get_chebi_data, the returned chebi dict is populated in two sub-stages. One populates
        'basic' information, where we can just copy substrings out of the xml response into the chebi dict. The second
        stage uses a class called ChebiPopulator, which handles more 'advanced' information extraction. In some cases 
        we need to iterate over a xml.find result, or we need to build up dictionary objects to represent more 
        complicated data models (such as citations or database links). 
        I have tried to use dict comprehensions where possible, with the reference keys stored in the 
        CompoundBuilderConfig. I find this to be readable and clean, compared to v1 of this script where we had endless 
        try / except blocks, one for each attempt to assign a single field to a dictionary.
        Once the advanced dict is ready, the basic and the advanced dict are returned in a new dict together using
         pythons dict unpacking operator like so {**dict1, **dict2}

    Stage 3: Merge chebi dict with our dict
        This stage merges the result of the previous stage with the compound dict we initialised in stage 1. This takes 
        place entirely within (an admittedly complex) dict comprehension. The reason for the chebi dict and our compound
        dict having different keys is that the method was rewritten fairly close to the original implementation, and I 
        didn't want to tamper with it too much. A future iteration of this script could have the chebi dict be populated
        in such a manner that it could just be merged directly with our compound dict, without the need for a big dict 
        comprehension and storing a bunch of keys and maps in config.

    Stage 4: Multi threaded external API calls
        This is the main change from version 1 of the script. Previously, calls to external API endpoints were made in 
        sequence. With this version of the script, each external API that we hit has a dedicated thread for doing so. 
        This is managed in part by pythons relatively new ThreadPoolExecutor class (read more about the 
        ThreadPoolExecutor class here: https://superfastpython.com/threadpoolexecutor-in-python/ ). The RuntimeFlags 
        config object dictates which external API threads will be enabled. If a flag is set to false, we insert an 
        'empty' dict into the results.

        The external API's that we currently hit are:
            - KEGG: https://www.kegg.jp/ for pathway information.
            - Wikipathways: https://www.wikipathways.org/ for pathway information.
            - EuropePMC: https://europepmc.org/ for citation information.
            - Cactus: https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure for compound structure information.
            - Rhea: https://www.rhea-db.org/ for reactions information.
            - MoNa: https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/ for spectra data.

        To add to this list, you will need to implement an API function in ExternalAPIHitter, a wrapper for that API 
        function (more detail on wrappers below), and configure the inputs for that function in the ataronchronon,
         function and add the new wrapper function the list functions to be given to a thread, also in ataronchronon. 
        The actual API endpoint should be held within a config object, like the others, so we have all endpoints in one 
        place for reference. 

        In the ataronchronon function, the inputs for each API thread are collected into a tuple ( as ThreadPoolExecutor
        threads to my understanding only take a single input), and those tuples are collected into a list. We also 
        collect each 'wrapper' function into a list , where each 'wrapper' function simply unpacks the tuple of inputs, 
        and calls the actual API method with those inputs. Each wrapper/actual function combination can be found in the 
        class ExternalAPIHitter. 
        Using these two lists, we create a list of 'futures' objects where each future is the eventual output of a given
         thread. Each thread returns a standard dict that follows the format {'name': 'spectra', 'results': {...}}. 
         Once each thread has completed, the list of these result dicts is returned.

    Stage 5: Sorting results from multi threaded process
        The results from the previous stage are somewhat raw, and need further processing and sorting before being added
        to the compound dict. To this end we have a class called ExternalAPIResultSorter. It takes in the results of the
        multithreaded process, and the in progress compound dict and iterates over each result dict. Using the name of 
        the result dict, it retrieves and calls the associated 'handling' function (one for each external API). The 
        handling function processes the results, and inserts them into the compound dict. Any empty results are logged 
        out and the relevant field in the dict set to an empty signifier. 'Flags' are also set here, indicating the 
        presence of a type of data. These 'flags' are used in the UI to decide whether to try and render a certain 
        portion of the compound data.

    Stage 6: Final odds and ends, and saving the dict to file
        There are some bits of data outstanding from the previous version that I couldn't integrate elsewhere. They are:
            - Processing reactome pathways from the reactome.json file. This is done in a single function called 
            get_reactome_data, and that function just tries to retrieve the slice corresponding to the current compound 
            ID.
            - Processing NMR data for this compound, using the results of our Compounds java webservice call. The legacy
            java web project also holds some compound information (aside from the list of ID's), which we use here 
            solely for populating the NMR field of the compound dict. We do this in a function called get_nmr
        Once the above functions have run, we set the flags that were not accounted for in the ExternalAPIResultSorter
        .sort function. These flags are 'hasPathways', 'hasNMR' and 'hasSpecies'. Again, these flags drive the UI by 
        telling it whether or not to attempt to load a particular portion of compound data.
        At this point, the compound is saved as a .json file in the destination directory in its own unique subdirectory
        . The dict itself is also returned, but nothing is done with it in the script that calls it 
        ( StartCompoundBuilder.py ), but is useful if you want to do some debugging, so I have left it as is.

Further Notes:
    Worth checking out the different ExternalAPIHitter methods to see what they do. One, get_ms_from_mona, includes file
    I/O operations. As a result this one method is a significant drag on the multithreaded process. Future versions of 
    this script could do with splitting out this portion entirely.

    There are some custom decorators I have written to save writing the same try except blocks over and over. While it
    obscures the root cause a little, you can see for which compound and what method the exception was thrown on. Since 
    we are processing so much data, I decided this level of exception handling was ok.

    Some tests would be good, could even have one that built 50 or so real compound directories locally for 
    scrutinisation. Not completed at the time due to other high priority tasks.

    The venv for this script must be maintained manually. Any new dependencies will require you to login to codon and
    install the requirements.txt again (obviously make your your new dependency is added to requirements.txt, and 
    transfer that to codon, to allow us to keep track at least somewhat).

    If you want to make this script single threaded for whatever reason, you can change the following line:
    `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=x)` in ataronchron, and replace whatever the current value of x 
    is to 1.

Output:
    The script saves the compound and any intermediate data files to the specified output directory.
